# Analyzing-IAM-financials

The present report is a synthesis of the work carried out within the framework of
the project of Data preprocessing , carried out within the ENSIAS, a big school of
engineers specialized in Technologies of the Information and the Communication. Its
missions are the training of state engineers and research for the technological and eco-
nomic development of Morocco.
The mission we have been given is part of the collection of data by webscraping
and also preparing it in order to improve its quality before processing, transforming it
into the best format for machine learning, through the main phases : Data Cleaning,
Data Visualisation and dimensionnality reduction. High quality data is more essential
for complex algorithms, thatâ€™s why this phase is incredibly important and should not
be skipped.We have been interested on topics relatively related to Finance especially
for the moroccan compagny widely known " IAM ".
